# Creating Cursor Rules

This rule teaches the agent how to create new rules following our established conventions.

## Context

Apply this rule when:
- Creating a new rule file
- Updating the rules system
- Adding coding standards or conventions
- User asks about rule structure

## Naming Convention

Rules follow the pattern: `[prefix]-[category]-[name].mdc`

### Number Ranges

| Range       | Category              | Purpose                                                                                                             | Examples                                               |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **000-099** | **Core & Behavior**   | Universal standards that apply to _how_ the agent works. High-level directives, persona, and workflow requirements. | `000-core-behavior.mdc` `010-core-planning.mdc`        |
| **100-199** | **Languages**         | Rules specific to a programming language syntax and base conventions.                                               | `100-lang-typescript.mdc` `110-lang-python.mdc`        |
| **200-299** | **Frameworks**        | Specific to libraries and frameworks built on top of languages.                                                     | `200-react-patterns.mdc` `210-nextjs-app-router.mdc`   |
| **300-399** | **Testing & QA**      | Standards for writing tests, mocking, and quality assurance.                                                        | `300-testing-jest.mdc` `310-e2e-cypress.mdc`           |
| **400-499** | **Tools & Infra**     | Configuration for external tools, DevOps, and version control.                                                      | `400-tool-git.mdc` `410-infra-docker.mdc`              |
| **800-899** | **Project Specifics** | Business logic, domain knowledge, and specific project workflows that don't fit generic categories.                 | `800-domain-billing.mdc` `810-workflow-deploy.mdc`     |
| **900-999** | **Meta & System**     | Rules for maintaining the rule system itself. Instructions on how to create new rules or skills.                    | `900-meta-create-rule.mdc` `901-meta-create-skill.mdc` |

## Standard Rule Structure

Every rule MUST follow this template:

```markdown
---
description: [Action-oriented description with trigger keywords]
globs: [File patterns, omit if alwaysApply is true]
alwaysApply: [true/false]
---

# [Rule Name]

## Context
[When to apply this rule]

## Standards
- [Rule 1]
- [Rule 2]

## Examples
[Bad vs Good code examples]

## Common Commands
[Project-specific commands relevant to this rule]
```

## Frontmatter Guidelines

### description
- Action-oriented and specific
- Include trigger keywords the agent should recognize
- Describe WHAT the rule does and WHEN to use it
- Max 1024 characters

### globs
- File patterns for file-specific rules (e.g., `**/*.ts`, `**/*.tsx`)
- Omit if `alwaysApply: true`

### alwaysApply
- `true`: Rule applies to every chat session
- `false`: Rule applies intelligently based on context or file patterns

## Best Practices

### Keep Rules Concise
- Target **under 500 lines**
- Split large rules into multiple focused rules
- One concern per rule

### Provide Examples
- Use Bad ❌ vs Good ✅ format
- Show concrete code examples
- Reference actual files when applicable

### Be Actionable
- Write like clear internal documentation
- Avoid vague guidance
- Provide specific, implementable standards

### Avoid Duplicating Knowledge
- Don't copy entire style guides (use linters instead)
- Don't document every command (agent knows common tools)
- Point to canonical examples instead of copying code
- Focus on project-specific patterns

## Examples

### Always Apply Rule

```markdown
---
description: Core agent behavior and workflow standards
alwaysApply: true
---

# Core Behavior

## Context
This rule always applies to establish base behavior.

## Standards
- Use Plan Mode for complex tasks
- Create todos for multi-step work
```

### File-Specific Rule

```markdown
---
description: TypeScript coding standards and conventions
globs: **/*.ts
alwaysApply: false
---

# TypeScript Standards

## Context
Apply when working with TypeScript files.

## Standards
- Use explicit return types for functions
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for objects
```

## Common Commands

- Create a new rule: Use the `scaffold-resource` skill
- List all rules: `ls .cursor/rules/`
- Validate rules: Use the `validate-system` skill
