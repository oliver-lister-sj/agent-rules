# Creating Agent Skills

This rule teaches the agent how to create Agent Skills following the open standard and best practices.

## Context

Apply this rule when:
- Creating a new skill
- Setting up workflow automation
- User asks about skill structure
- Maintaining the `.cursor/skills/` directory

## Skill Structure

Skills are directories containing a `SKILL.md` file:

```
.cursor/skills/
└── my-skill/
    ├── SKILL.md          # Required
    ├── scripts/          # Optional - executable code
    ├── references/       # Optional - detailed docs
    └── assets/           # Optional - templates, data
```

## SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: [What it does and when to use it]
disable-model-invocation: [true/false]
---

# Skill Name

## When to Use
- Trigger scenario 1
- Trigger scenario 2

## Instructions
[Step-by-step guidance for the agent]

## Usage
[Examples of using this skill]
```

## Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Lowercase, hyphens only. Max 64 chars. Must match folder name. |
| `description` | Yes | What and when. Include trigger keywords. Max 1024 chars. |
| `disable-model-invocation` | No | If `true`, only invoked via `/skill-name` |
| `license` | No | License name or file reference |
| `compatibility` | No | System requirements |

## Writing Effective Descriptions

Descriptions are CRITICAL for skill discovery. The agent uses them to decide when to apply.

### Best Practices

1. **Third person** (injected into system prompt):
   - ✅ Good: "Processes Excel files and generates reports"
   - ❌ Avoid: "I can help you process Excel files"

2. **Be specific with trigger terms**:
   - ✅ Good: "Extract text from PDFs, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction."
   - ❌ Vague: "Helps with documents"

3. **Include WHAT and WHEN**:
   - WHAT: Specific capabilities
   - WHEN: Trigger scenarios

## Content Guidelines

### Keep SKILL.md Under 500 Lines

The main file should be concise. Use progressive disclosure for detailed content.

### Concise is Key

Challenge each piece of information:
- "Does the agent really need this explanation?"
- "Can I assume the agent knows this?"
- "Does this justify its token cost?"

✅ **Good (concise)**:
```markdown
## Extract PDF text

Use pdfplumber:

\`\`\`python
import pdfplumber

with pdfplumber.open("file.pdf") as pdf:
    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
\`\`\`
```

❌ **Bad (verbose)**:
```markdown
## Extract PDF text

PDF files are a common format that contains text and images.
To extract text, you'll need to use a library. There are many
libraries available, but we recommend pdfplumber because...
```

### Progressive Disclosure

Put essential info in SKILL.md; detailed reference in separate files:

```markdown
## Quick start
[Essential instructions here]

## Additional resources
- For API details, see [reference.md](reference.md)
- For examples, see [examples.md](examples.md)
```

Keep references one level deep - link directly from SKILL.md.

## Including Scripts

Skills can include executable code in `scripts/` directory:

```markdown
## Usage

Run the deployment script: `scripts/deploy.sh <environment>`

## Pre-deployment Validation

Run: `python scripts/validate.py`
```

Scripts should be:
- Self-contained
- Include helpful error messages
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Written in any executable language

## Common Patterns

### Template Pattern

Provide output format templates:

```markdown
## Report structure

Use this template:

\`\`\`markdown
# [Analysis Title]

## Executive summary
[One-paragraph overview]

## Key findings
- Finding 1 with data
- Finding 2 with data
\`\`\`
```

### Workflow Pattern

Break complex operations into clear steps:

```markdown
## Workflow

Copy this checklist:

\`\`\`
Task Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Analyze
- [ ] Step 2: Map
- [ ] Step 3: Validate
- [ ] Step 4: Execute
\`\`\`

**Step 1: Analyze**
Run: \`python scripts/analyze.py input.pdf\`
```

### Conditional Workflow

Guide through decision points:

```markdown
## Workflow

1. Determine the type:

   **Creating new?** → Follow "Creation workflow"
   **Editing existing?** → Follow "Editing workflow"

2. Creation workflow:
   - Use docx-js library
   - Build from scratch
```

## Examples

### Good Description Examples

```yaml
# PDF Processing
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.

# Git Commit Helper
description: Generate descriptive commit messages by analyzing git diffs. Use when the user asks for help writing commit messages or reviewing staged changes.
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Windows-Style Paths
- ✅ Use: `scripts/helper.py`
- ❌ Avoid: `scripts\helper.py`

### Too Many Options
```markdown
❌ Bad: "You can use pypdf, or pdfplumber, or PyMuPDF..."

✅ Good: "Use pdfplumber for text extraction.
For scanned PDFs requiring OCR, use pytesseract instead."
```

### Vague Skill Names
- ✅ Good: `processing-pdfs`, `analyzing-spreadsheets`
- ❌ Avoid: `helper`, `utils`, `tools`

## Common Commands

- Create a new skill: Use the `scaffold-resource` skill
- List all skills: `ls .cursor/skills/`
- Test skill invocation: Type `/skill-name` in chat
