# React State Management

Standards and conventions for managing state in React applications.

## Context

Apply this rule when deciding how to manage state in React components.

## Standards

### State Management

- Use `useState` for local component state
- Use `useReducer` for complex state logic
- Lift state up when shared between components
- Use context for widely-shared state or to avoid prop drilling > 3 layers
- Prefer stateless components where possible for easier testing
