# Project Structure

## Context
Apply this rule when adding new files or refactoring the directory structure in frontend projects.

## Standards

### Top-Level Directory Structure (`src/`)

| Directory | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `components/` | React components, organized by feature. |
| `hooks/` | Custom React hooks shared across multiple components. |
| `models/` | TypeScript interfaces and type definitions (domain models). |
| `resources/` | Localization resources, text strings, and constants. |
| `services/` | API services and external integrations. |
| `utils/` | Shared utility functions and helpers. |
| `constants/` | Global constants and configuration values. |

### Component Structure (`src/components/[FeatureName]/`)

- **Feature Folders**: Group related components into a feature folder (e.g., `TalentScorePanel`).
- **Entry Point**: Each feature folder MUST have an `index.tsx` that exports the main component.
- **Sub-components**: Place sub-components in their own sub-folders within the feature folder (e.g., `TalentScorePanel/Content`).
- **Tests**: Colocate tests in a `__tests__` directory within the component's folder.
  - **Naming**: Test files MUST use the component/folder name (e.g., `TalentScorePanel.test.tsx`), NOT `index.test.tsx`.
- **Styles**: Keep styles (using `makeSxStyles`) within the component file or in a separate file in the same directory if large.

### File Placement Guidelines

- **New Feature**: Create a new folder in `src/components/`.
- **Shared Logic**: Extract to a custom hook in `src/hooks/` if used by multiple features.
- **API Calls**: Define in `src/services/` and use via hooks.
- **Types**: Define in `src/models/` if shared, or colocated with the component if specific to it.

## Examples

### Feature Component Structure

```
src/components/TalentScorePanel/
├── index.tsx              # Main export
├── Content/               # Sub-component folder
│   ├── index.tsx
│   └── __tests__/         # Tests for Content
│       └── Content.test.tsx
├── ScoreItem/             # Sub-component folder
│   └── index.tsx
└── __tests__/             # Tests for TalentScorePanel
    └── TalentScorePanel.test.tsx
```

### Shared Hook Structure

```
src/hooks/
├── useMatchingFactors.ts  # Shared hook
└── __tests__/             # Tests for hooks
    └── useMatchingFactors.test.ts
```
